# iso2mdc
This is a quick-and-dirty desktop application I slapped together both as practice for using
Swing and as an actual application of my [Modern Digital Calendar](https://github.com/xmercerweiss/Modern-Digital-Calendar) 
library. This project provides no documentation or testing whatsoever and was written in my free time over the course of 
about a week. It is likely quite buggy.

The application provides two calendar widgets from which you can select a date in either the Gregorian or
Modern Digital calendar. The opposite calendar will select its equivalent date, and a long form description
of each date will be listed under each calendar. 

The JAR is provided in `/dist` if you'd like to try it out.
